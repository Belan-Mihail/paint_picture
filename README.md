## Front-End

### React

The library for web and native user interfaces ([source](https://react.dev/)).

I used React for this application for several reasons:
- Speed - applying React significantly increases the page loading speed and reducing the wait, which affects user experience and satisfaction
- Flexibility - the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure, compared to other front-end frameworks
- React Bootstrap - excellent choice for improving user experience, used for styling and responsiveness. It comes with ready-to-use React built components. They are implemented with accessibility in mind, which is a vital factor when creating a front-end application. I used plain Bootstrap in my previous projects, so it was an easy choice to use React Bootstrap in this app.
- Most used library for developing social networking and media content applications 
- Reusability of components - no need to write various codes for the same features

#### Front-End Components

- `<Asset />` - a multi-purpose component used to display a number of elements while the main component receives data from the server. it includes: a loading spinner from React Bootstrap, image with source and alt attribute or a message consisting of a paragraph. (**User stories covered: 45**)

- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to render profile images in the UI. Passed props allow for setting image source and size, adjust image dimensions depending on where the component is rendered. This component also displays the user's greeting. Example of use include the `<NavBar />` component, Picture page or Profile page. (**User stories covered: 12, 14**)

- `<Greeting Modal />` - a component that is used to display general information about the site when user first visit it. (**User stories covered: 7**)

- `<ModeSwitch />` - a component that is used to switch the color scheme of the site with available values: light, turquoise and orange. This component appears on every page of the site under the navigation component. (**User stories covered: 6**)

- `<DropdownMenu />` - reusable component, used to render the dropdown menu which is used to provide the user with the ability to edit or delete their own pictures, plans, wallitems and comments, and also edit their profile or change profile password. (**User stories covered: 5, 9, 10, 17, 19,34, 37, 40**)

- `<NavBar />` - reusable component with the content depending on the login status of the user. For logged in user it shows icon link to add picture and plan, home page and user avatar/picture. For those who are not logged in, it displays icon links to sign up or log in instead of the avatar. The component is used on each page of the app. (**User stories covered: 1, 2, 3, 4 16, 36, 42, 43**)

- `<NotFound />` - specific component for displaying a 404 graphic error message with a return to menu button when user enters the url which does not exist. (**User stories covered: 5**)

- `<PictureOrderingFilter />` reusable component which will allow user to set the order of display of pictures depending on the number of likes (high and low) and also depending on the number of comments (high and low) (**User stories covered: 29, 30**)

- `<ToTop />` reusable component which will allow user rise to the top of the page after, which increases the level of usability of the site. this component is displayed on pages where the user can âgo down a lotâ for example: Pictures Page, Profile Page  (**User stories covered: 5**)

### Lighthouse Validation

NOTE: The results of testing individual pages of the Lighthouse project (in terms of performance) may be underestimated and contradictory, primarily due to the fact that the computer used for testing was quite old (2010), which could affect the results. In addition, unfortunately, I had problems with the Internet connection throughout the entire work with the project, which could also negatively affect the results when testing performance. Additionally, performance degradation on individual pages may be due to the functionality of user-loaded images. Hosting a project on Heroku may affect results (server response time, caching, and network latency). Also, additional external libraries reduce the response of the site. At the same time, the performance level of all pages remains quite high


Lighthouse was used to test the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO of the site.

| After creating the first message on the wall, the user was not displayed on the screen | This bug occurred due to the animation of messages on the wall. The animation has been removed from this component |

| The greeting that appeared when you hovered over the image of an avatar located in the navigation menu violated the structure of the navigation menu by moving the avatar below the level of other links | the hover function was changed which did not display a greeting if its value was null, and the corresponding value was passed to the avatar component that was rendered in the navigation menu |
| during file validation, an empty file was found that did not contain more than one style, imported and used in a separate component | the corresponding style was added for the component element referencing this style module |
| there were no auxiliary comments in the project files, which would impair understanding of the code | auxiliary comments were added to various elements and components |
| During WAVE validation, contrasting errors in the logo and text colors of some buttons were identified | the color styles of these elements have been clarified to avoid errors |
| after the final deployment it was discovered that the comment after deletion remains on the page until it is reloaded | the comment model has been supplemented with the history go back function |

## Credits

### Images

- All images (except those indicated in paragraph 2) used on the site were created by me using the [Paint](https://getpaint.net/)
- Pictures from user Alisa belong to my 7 year old daughter Alisa Bilan and were authorized by the author for use in the project. these pictures are also created using [Paint](https://getpaint.net/)


### Code

This project was inspired by the ['Moments'](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) social media platform which was a final walk-through project with Code Institute. I have built my own styles and added extra functionality:
- filtering of picture based on their category; 
- ordering picture based of number of likes and comments;
- added animation
- many site elements have been modified (for example, profile card)
- the models provided in the project were changed and new ones not used in the project were created
- additional hover effects have been created for buttons and components
- new components were created including contextual components
- added color scheme change
- added display of a welcome modal window with information about the site

***But at the same time, I recognize more the influence of the educational project and the importance of this project***

The ideas below were taken as the basis for some components, elements or effects of the site:

[useHover hook](https://clouddevs.com/react/usehover-hook/) - the idea was used to create a hover effect on the avatar component to display a users greeting.

[color schemes](https://medium.com/lets-make-something-up/creating-light-dark-mode-on-a-react-app-with-context-589a5465f639) - the idea was used to create functionality for changing the color scheme of the site


[select-onchange](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-select-onchange) - the idea was used to create functionality for changing the color scheme of the site and creating functionality for changing the display ordering of pictures

[aos](https://aguidehub.com/blog/2023-04-05-how-to-install-and-use-aos-in-react-js/) - the material was studied to add AOS animation to the project

[button shine](https://dev.to/designyff/button-with-shine-animation-step-by-step-guide-15l5) - the idea was used to create a beautiful hover effect for the follow unfollow buttons

[popup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48882300/create-a-first-visit-popup-in-react-application) - The functionality of the welcome user window is based on this material

[flip card](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41461101/flip-a-3d-card-with-css) - the idea was used to create a flip profile card
