   <img src="docs/agile/kanban-board.jpg">
   </details>

This project was the second time I used agile development methods. The importance of these principles is beyond doubt. There may have been certain inaccuracies in the use of all the principles of this methodology.

## Front-End

### React

The library for web and native user interfaces ([source](https://react.dev/)).

I used React for this application for several reasons:
- Speed - applying React significantly increases the page loading speed and reducing the wait, which affects user experience and satisfaction
- Flexibility - the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure, compared to other front-end frameworks
- React Bootstrap - excellent choice for improving user experience, used for styling and responsiveness. It comes with ready-to-use React built components. They are implemented with accessibility in mind, which is a vital factor when creating a front-end application. I used plain Bootstrap in my previous projects, so it was an easy choice to use React Bootstrap in this app.
- Most used library for developing social networking and media content applications 
- Reusability of components - no need to write various codes for the same features

#### Front-End Components

- `<Asset />` - a multi-purpose component used to display a number of elements while the main component receives data from the server. it includes: a loading spinner from React Bootstrap, image with source and alt attribute or a message consisting of a paragraph. (**User stories covered: 45**)

- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to render profile images in the UI. Passed props allow for setting image source and size, adjust image dimensions depending on where the component is rendered. This component also displays the user's greeting. Example of use include the `<NavBar />` component, Picture page or Profile page. (**User stories covered: 12, 14**)

- `<Greeting Modal />` - a component that is used to display general information about the site when user first visit it. (**User stories covered: 7**)

- `<ModeSwitch />` - a component that is used to switch the color scheme of the site with available values: light, turquoise and orange. This component appears on every page of the site under the navigation component. (**User stories covered: 6**)

- `<DropdownMenu />` - reusable component, used to render the dropdown menu which is used to provide the user with the ability to edit or delete their own pictures, plans, wallitems and comments, and also edit their profile or change profile password. (**User stories covered: 5, 9, 10, 17, 19,34, 37, 40**)

- `<NavBar />` - reusable component with the content depending on the login status of the user. For logged in user it shows icon link to add picture and plan, home page and user avatar/picture. For those who are not logged in, it displays icon links to sign up or log in instead of the avatar. The component is used on each page of the app. (**User stories covered: 1, 2, 3, 4 16, 36, 42, 43**)

- `<NotFound />` - specific component for displaying a 404 graphic error message with a return to menu button when user enters the url which does not exist. (**User stories covered: 5**)

- `<PictureOrderingFilter />` reusable component which will allow user to set the order of display of pictures depending on the number of likes (high and low) and also depending on the number of comments (high and low) (**User stories covered: 29, 30**)

- `<ToTop />` reusable component which will allow user rise to the top of the page after, which increases the level of usability of the site. this component is displayed on pages where the user can âgo down a lotâ for example: Pictures Page, Profile Page  (**User stories covered: 5**)
