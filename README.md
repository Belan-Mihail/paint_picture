   </details>

- create Milestones
   <details><summary>Milestones</summary>
   <img src="docs/agile/milestones.jpg">
   </details>
- create project [Link to project](https://github.com/users/Belan-Mihail/projects/8)
- create issues (based on the template). A total of 46 issues were created
   <details><summary>Issues</summary>

   <img src="docs/agile/kanban-board.jpg">
   </details>

This project was the second time I used agile development methods. The importance of these principles is beyond doubt. There may have been certain inaccuracies in the use of all the principles of this methodology.

  - [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) - used to evaluate application accessibility

## Front-End

### React

The library for web and native user interfaces ([source](https://react.dev/)).

I used React for this application for several reasons:
- Speed - applying React significantly increases the page loading speed and reducing the wait, which affects user experience and satisfaction
- Flexibility - the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure, compared to other front-end frameworks
- React Bootstrap - excellent choice for improving user experience, used for styling and responsiveness. It comes with ready-to-use React built components. They are implemented with accessibility in mind, which is a vital factor when creating a front-end application. I used plain Bootstrap in my previous projects, so it was an easy choice to use React Bootstrap in this app.
- Most used library for developing social networking and media content applications 
- Reusability of components - no need to write various codes for the same features
